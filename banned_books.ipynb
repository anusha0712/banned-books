    "PEN America releases an annual list of book banning incidents in schools across the nation. Their indices are available for the three academic years starting from 2021 to 2024. The dataset includes data points for book titles, authors and series banned, geographical details and the date and authority of challenge. A book \"challenge\" is when someone like a parent, lawmaker or community member, complains about the book on the basis of its content and deems it unfit. In response to challenges, the book in question is investigated and taken off the shelf for the duration of the investigation. The result of the investigation will determine whether the book is returned to the shelf, banned in libraries, in classrooms or both. \n",
    "\n",
    "Banning books is often seen as an act of censorship meant to diminish intellectual freewill of citizens. While one side of it involves shielding young minds from 'inappropriate' or 'sexually explicit' content, the fact of the matter is that censorship often results in taboos, stigmas or shame being attached to certain topics in society. Additionally, as we move forward as a liberal and more inclusive society, the definition of what is 'inappropriate' or 'sexually explicit' remains in a state of flux. Topics exploring LGBTQ+ love or one's own sexuality or identity and difficult narratives on race are often blanketly deemed inappropriate and banned. Instead of stigmatizing them, real efforts should be made to encourage discussion and to debate the complex nuances of the realities that we live in, especially within the safety of our educational systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is an exploration of the Index of banned books, attempting to parse out authors that have faced heavy censorship, states that lead in such challenges and any trends in the number and types of books being banned. \n",
